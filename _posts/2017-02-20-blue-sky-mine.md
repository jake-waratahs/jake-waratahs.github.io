Two weeks in, and I'm starting to hit a rhythm, or at least that's what it feels like sometimes. Wake up, have brekky, get the shuttle in to work, go to work, come home, cook dinner. Some days I'll see my friends, others I wont. Times like this make me jealous of all the university students, going back for O Week, going to parties, having no responsibilities... That's the life, I tell you.

I've had a number of successes this week too - we were finally approved to get our apartment, and we get the keys on Thursday. It's really slick and modern, and it's got a view of downtown Redwood City, which is fantastic. I can't wait to move out of this hotel and live with other people. I've also been approved to open a bank account and get a social security card, both of which are on their way. Now, about that paycheck...

Work has been good this week too. I've managed to get through training and the issues I've been assigned so far without too much difficulty. I've done some work so far improving one of Facebook's internal analytics tools, which has been interesting and a good introduction to how things are done in this part of the world. Also, if you've used Instagram at all in the past five days, then you have used code that I have written. How cool is that!?

On Friday night, I decided to head out to the local Synagogue and see what the service there was like - very different was the answer. There was no separate gallery for women, the Rabbi played Maracas during the prayers and they had a female chazzan leading the service. The Rabbi invited me for dinner after, where he showed me all the apps on his phone that he uses to follow the Geelong Cats (the bloke has never been to Australia but knows more about AFL then I do). After dinner, he gave me a lift home in his car. While it was totally different to anything I was used to, it still felt like home, and Lecha Dodi sounds the same wherever you are in the world.

Thankfully, today is a public holiday here, which means a long weekend for us. I went into San Francisco again yesterday to do a bit of exploring. I walked along the Embarcadero at the bayfront, and then up Lombard street to take in the wonderful view of the city. I haven't yet been to Golden Gate park, but I've been told that I'll love it there.

I met my friends Oliver, Vanessa, Pierre, George, Steven, Bernice and Nicola (all Sydney natives) for dinner at a Hawaiian themed restaurant, where a burger cost $2.35. We then got ice cream and went back to hang out at Oliver and Vanessa's place in South Beach.

At the moment, we are going through what the locals call a "freak storm", or what I would call "some mild rain". The roads and infrastructure here really aren't build to handle it at all, and it's kind of scary when people have no idea how to drive in the wet. It *almost* makes me miss Sydney drivers. *Almost*.

Anyway, there are some big weeks ahead! I'm moving into our apartment this week, and Mum is coming to visit this weekend. The weekend after, I'm off to Vegas with Dad to watch the Rugby Sevens, and I cannot wait! Bring it on!
