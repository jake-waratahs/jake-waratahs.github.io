Hello and welcome again to my blog! Now that its less than a week until I leave for ~~greener pastures~~ the USA, I've changed things up a bit to be part portfolio, part diary for my time in the states. A bunch of time has passed and plenty has happened since I announced I was leaving, so I figured it was time for an update.

### What have I been doing with myself?
Since arriving back from South America in December, I've been hanging out with friends, going to the beach, and also doing a bit of tutoring. I was lucky enough to be invited back to the [National Computer Science School](ncss.edu.au) as a tutor this year, after being a student in 2012 and 2013. Seeing the program change the students lives the same way it changed mine was just incredible and I couldn't think of a better experience to have these holidays.

I then had the opportunity to be one of the organisers for the newly created ACCESS for Women program at UNSW. Run by the School of CSE in conjunction with CSESoc, we got thirty six women from high schools around the country and taught them how to code and gave them a few projects, including GPS trackers and some other really cool stuff. It was so wonderful to see these girls walk up and just be friends and be so great to each other.

After these experiences, I've been so inspired to get my hands dirty and start writing code again. I've been hacking away at a project that I'll post about in a few weeks, but other than that, I'm seriously ready to start working hard again.

### Yep, I'm still going
In August I accepted an offer from Facebook to relocate to the Bay Area, south of San Francisco, in California. I've always wanted to live and work overseas, and this is the right time in my life to do it. Despite protests from my friends, I'm still going. Despite the US election result, and hostile rhetoric towards migrants, I'm still going. Despite the fact that it's currently 30&deg;C in Sydney and 9&deg;C in San Francisco, I'm still going.

I suppose I've realised how big a challenge this move is going to be. Moving to a different country is terrifying enough without millions of people getting angry about immigrants coming and taking "American Jobs". I also realise though, that with white skin and English as my first language, I have it a lot better than some of the other people moving over. I'll try and help less fortunate people and stand up for them when I can. People don't hate Australians, right?


### Pack Er Up, Boiz
I've started packing my suitcases, which is terrifying, because it is all starting to feel a little too real at the moment. I've had three farewell events, and probably more this week, which is really sad but it is also a really good chance to get to see all of my friends before I go. Although some people really don't like it when I tell them that I've started packing, or that I have my flight tickets, or anything that feels like I'm actually leaving.

### Logistics
I leave on Sunday February 5th on QF73 direct to San Francisco, and from the airport I'm heading to an apartment in Redwood City that I'll be staying in for the first few weeks, before I find my own place. After that, I'll be looking for places to live with two of my close friends.

I'll be back in Sydney towards the end of June (about 137 days from today, January 30th.)

### How good is Sydney?
Geez this city is incredible. All of my friends who have had the good fortune to travel the world agree that it is the best city in the world. From the sprawling beaches, the clean air, the parks, the safety of the streets, this city is absolutely glorious and I wouldn't have wanted to grow up anywhere else in the world. I've been to Bondi every day for the past week or so and I don't think I will ever get sick of it. 

I'm really *really* going to miss this place.
