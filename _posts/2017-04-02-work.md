I really wish I had a more exciting update for you all this week. The sad truth is that I'm well and truly settled into a mundane reality here - get up, go to work, come home, have dinner, go to sleep, rinse and repeat. Even the weekend was relatively uneventful compared to my whirlwind first eight weeks here.

<!--break-->

This week was my first real week on the Profile Expression team at work, and I'm working hard at the moment to prove that I belong there, although often it feels like I'm trying to convince myself just as much as I'm trying to convince my team members. My team is amazing though and I love them. I left a meeting on Monday in absolute stitches just because everyone is so funny and happy and welcoming. I've also got my desk set up now too, and it's nice to finally have my own space.


The hard work is paying off though, and I've shipped code every day this week, which feels good. I'm transitioning from web development to Android development, which is going to be real fun and an interesting step up.

It was a bit of a lazy chilled out weekend but there was plenty of fun times as well. On Friday night, Pierre, Vincent and I made plans to go out for dinner on Castro Street Mountain View<sup>\[1\]</sup>. It turned out that one of their mates from UNSW was in town for a Google conference, so we were four Aussie boys hanging out at my new mate Luke's digs.

We set out for dinner, and Luke invites one of his mates from High School, who now lives in the Bay. Vincent mentioned that his neighbour from across the way hails from Adelaide, so we invited him to join the party, and suddenly we were six Australians sinking beers, wandering, yelling and laughing our down the main drag, wearing different clothes than the locals, talking in strange accents and taking up the whole path.

We ended the night sitting on the roof of Luke's hotel, with more beer, talking about Australian music and comedians, taking the piss and chewing the fat.

On Saturday night, John and I went up to San Francisco to see Methyl Ethyl - an Australian band from Perth (tickets cost $12<sup>\[2\]</sup>). We went with another group of Australians that I met at an "Australians in San Francisco" drinks night a few weeks back. There's Lauren from Manly who has lived in Darlinghurst, Michelle, who has been from Melbourne to Byron to Port Douglas<sup>\[3\]</sup>, and Manny, who has lived around Pyrmont way. We had a great time at the gig, and plan to go to Midnight Oil and Paul Kelly, who are both playing in SF next month.

Sunday was a real laze about day. I took my book about Australian history and lay by the pool. Americans don't tend to do much on Sundays until about midday, so I had the joint pretty much to myself for the morning, and it was gorgeous. I was worried that my tan would fade, but it's been 26 degrees and sunny all weekend. Hope you're all enjoying Debbie's company back home though!

I baked another batch of ANZAC biscuits this weekend, which actually tasted decent. I also managed to make Chicken Shnitty this week too, but ate it all before I got the chance to take a photo. As I sat down this evening, it occurred to me that since I left work at around 5:30pm on Friday night, I have only interacted with Australians.

It's not news to anybody that once you're out of School and University, it becomes more difficult to make friends. The locals that I've met here are usually already steeped into their own social circles - it's not that anybody has been unwelcoming, but those social circles are hard to crack and I often feel like an outsider here, like I don't belong<sup>\[4\]</sup>.

And so for social interaction here, I deal with the friends I have already made (ie, Australians), and people I have a shared experience with and relate to easily (ie, Australians). I walked down to the shops today wearing board shorts and a singlet, and got strange looks from plenty of the locals. One of my mates here once wore shorts that sat above the knee and got told on the street that "people here don't wear that". A Lyft driver a few weeks ago mocked my accent, and made jokes about eating Kangaroos and throwing Boomerangs, which made me really uncomfortable.

But the thing is, I have white skin and English is my first language. Australia and America are two of the most similar countries on the planet, yet I still feel like the "other" here. I can't imagine how difficult it would be if I was a person of colour, or Middle Eastern, or if I was having to learn English at the same time. It's really easy to see how ethnic ghettos can form because I'm effectively living in one. 

And if the American military was using drones to bomb my family and friends back home, and if the American people then voted in a President who directly questions my human rights and my contribution to society, then too right, I'd want to fight back too.

I suppose that's the lesson I've learnt this week. Either way, it's eleven days until Mum, Dad and Dave come to visit, and seventy-five days until I come home. Not that I'm counting.
