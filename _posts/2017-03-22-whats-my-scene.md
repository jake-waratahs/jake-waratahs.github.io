Apologies for the late post this week. Work last week really flew by and then ground to a halt this week, as it turns out I'm competing with a bunch of people to get onto the team I wanted. I worked a bit more with them and it turns out I don't really fit in with them, so I'm likely going to be working on the Facebook side rather than the Instagram side.

But it hasn't all been about work! There's been plenty of fun and games in there too. Last Thursday I went out to an Australians in San Francisco meetup. Being a Thursday night, I figured that it would be just a few quiet drinks, but boy oh boy was I wrong. There were maybe thirty of us there and we racked up a pretty hefty bar tab between the lot of us. 

I made a bunch of friends, and it was nice to make jokes about smashed avo leading to expensive housing, whether I was more of a typical Bondi boy than my new friend Lauren was a typical Manly girl, etc. (We both went to private schools. I went to UNSW and she went to Sydney Uni. We called it a draw.)

Friday was Saint Patrick's day and jeez don't the seppos love it. Every single person I saw wore green for the entire weekend, and the nights were nuts. On Friday night I went out with a couple of the local Jewish kids and their mates. Again, I was expecting a few beers and home at a reasonable time, but the night ended with me buying a round of Petrone shots for everyone at 1:30am. As I stumbled home, the Waratahs were just kicking off in Sydney. I got about sixty minutes into the game before I couldn't take it anymore and went to sleep.

    Dunno what time of night this was taken. Somewhere in Redwood City between Friday night and Saturday morning.

Saturday I struggled up to San Francisco for brunch with Vincent and some friends from work. We went to Polk Street, which is what Oxford Street was like back when it was good. The place we chose was called "Friends with Benedicts", which was worth going to just on name along. I got smashed avo (yep, I'm never owning property ever) with smoked salmon, and to drink they actually served Kava. The rest of the gang were going to a beer festival at 8pm that night, and planned to do a pub crawl from 2pm until 8pm. I decided to leave them to it seeing as I had just had two big ones in a row, and I went back home to rest.

On Sunday, our good friend Nicola was in town once again for an interview. We took the opportunity to gather our entire social circle and go for dinner at a full on classic American Diner in Palo Alto. Milkshakes for all. Plenty of us got the beef ribs and New York Steak, where I went for the Chicken Parma. Eleven UNSW Computing Alumni getting dinner together in Palo Alto, California. How good.

On Monday, I went to the DMV. 0/10 would not do again. I got there will all my documents, before being told that since my Social Security Number was sent to my office and not my home, I couldn't have my residence in California verified, and couldn't sit the test. Last I checked, my office was in California. The average California driver gets into an accident once every two years. In five years of driving, I've never had a traffic accident, which probably puts me into the ninetieth percentile of drivers here. This morning, some selfish bastard spun out his Ford Mustang on the entrance ramp to the 101 Highway. And they wont let me get a license.

Onto happier news, and I've been branching out of my cooking habits - since living off Honey Soy Chicken and Spag Bol probably isn't sustainable. This week I went and bought some pastry sheets and beef stock, and made some meat pies. They were nowhere near as good as mum's, but I'm not unhappy with them for a first attempt.

    Not perfect, but not too bad. I was hungry enough to eat 'em.

I also found some Golden Syrup at a shop here and I'm going to try bake ANZAC Biscuits later on this week.

Anyway, that's all I have for now! Thanks for bearing with me while I write these - the next one is going to be a good one, I promise. Until then!
