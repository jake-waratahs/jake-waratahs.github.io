Looks like we're on to monthly updates now and not a moment too soon - I write to you from the International Terminal at San Francisco airport, about to board a Boeing 747 with a red painted tail. One hundred and thirty one days since departing Botany Bay on QF73, sitting in Seat 1A, I return, on QF74, in seat 44K. (Note the seat positioning so I can always see the harbour from the plane.)

Either way, plenty has happened since we last spoke. The week after Bay to Breakers and Paul Kelly, another set of Australian legends were in town. These blokes, straight out of the eighties, are known as Midnight Oil. You might have heard of them. They sing that song, Beds are Burning. Watching them live was un-be-livable. Firstly, Peter Garrat does actually dance like that. He's a madman. Secondly, they sound like a band in their prime. They haven't lost anything, and played for two hours, and did two encores. Highlights of the evening were Beds are Burning, King of the Mountain, an acoustic version of Koziousco and the drum solo from Power and the Passion, which Rob Hurst played on a piece of corrugated iron. I walked away from that concert feeling proud to be an Australian.

Later on that week, I flew up to Seattle on a business trip. It was really great to meet the team up there, and I loved the chance to see another American city. Fortunately, I caught Seattle on one of it's five sunny days per year and it was glorious. The city was clean, it was sunny and warm, there are parks everywhere and the air is fresh. Work went well and a bunch of us even got to go Go-Karting. All in all, a successful trip, even if I was staying in the kitchiest hotel in the history of kitchy hotels.

I landed in San Francisco on Friday night and took the first train up to the city on Saturday morning, since Dad and Granny Elaine were in town. We took the ferry up to Tiburon and enjoyed lunch and a stroll around there. Well, Dad and I enjoyed it, Elaine seemed to complain a fair bit about all the walking. Tiburon is a nice sleepy little town north of San Francisco (over the Golden Gate bridge). There's not all that much there except for restaurants, boutique shops and a lot of really nice houses. We got the ferry back to the city, and I caught up with some friends at a party in Pacific Heights while Dad and Elaine rested (jet lag, ya know).

After the party I came back down to the waterfront and we went out for dinner at a restaurant that Mum raves about but has never been to. I got the train home, and then the next day, Dad went on to the East Coast, while Elaine and I met in Palo Alto, which she loved, because Hayley, her favourite daughter, used to live at Stanford. We hung about there for a while and got lunch, before she came to see my apartment and then got on her way to the airport.

I hadn't had a mate from back home come stay with me yet, and thankfully last week I got my first! Mikey Garbuz and I went to school together and have been close since I can remember. He was in D.C. on a conference for AUJS, and decided to fly back to Sydney through San Francisco. On the Wednesday, we went for a 15km walk along the water, from AT&T park all the way through to the Marina District. When we got to the park at the marina waterfront, we saw a group of people running around and kicking a ball. The ball was oval shaped and red. They were kicking straight on and handballing it to each other. No way. It couldn't be. As we got closer, a stray ball landed at my feet. On the red ball, printed in black, it said:

"SHERRIN"

We had stumbled onto the San Francisco Roos AFL team. And they've convinced me to join up! Their games are huge community affiars, with Australian beers and Meat Pies sold on site. How good. I'm looking forward to pulling on the gurnsey.

That weekend, I met Dad again, this time in Los Angeles. We stayed in Beverley Hills, and on Sunday morning, did a huge walk from Santa Monica to Venice Beach, and along Abbott-Kinney, a lovely strip of shops that might as well be Double Bay. We spent the rest of the day lying by the pool, doing nothing - exactly what we had come to LA to do.

Quick sidebar here: back in 2013, I met a girl at a house party in Beaconsfield back in Sydney. She told me she was studying acting. A few years later, she moved to Los Angeles to continue studying, and as it happened, she had a show on at the Hollywood Fringe Festival when I was in town. I went along without telling her, and she was so shocked to see me there. The last time we saw each other was in January 2015 when I drunkenly stumbled into the bar she was working at.

After the show we went out for drinks, and it was so good to catch up and hear that an old friend is happy and doing well!

Which brings me to this week, where I saw Gang of Youths at a tiny bar in San Francisco. Gang of Youths are probably one of my favourite bands, they are outstanding live and have incredible lyrics. Before the show, I was hanging out the front of the venue, waiting for my friend Lauren, who had our tickets. The band was hanging out there too, and the lead singer, Dave, came over and gave me a huge hug and thanked me for coming to see the show. We chatted a bit about moving away from Australia (he recently relocated to London) before he ran off to get ready. The show was absolutely nuts, so so so good. Lauren, who had only heard a few songs, became a full convert. I walked away from the concert out onto the streets of Potrero Hill, a nice little suburb, thinking that life was good.

And now I sit here, at San Francisco International. I'm so excited to come back home, even if it is going to be thirty degrees every day in the Bay Area this week and half that in Sydney. I can't wait to see all my family and friends, the people who have supported me on this journey. I've got a huge goofy grin on my face, and I'm bound for Botany Bay.

I'll see you all soon.
