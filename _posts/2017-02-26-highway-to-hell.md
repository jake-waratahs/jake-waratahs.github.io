		I thought I should include an AC/DC song because I've been hearing Acca Dacca all week and I've spent far too much time on the highways here.

Last I left you, it was the end of a long weekend, which was filled with pouring rain. This week, the sun has come out, but it has been *cold*. Real cold. Three degrees Celsius cold. Sporting my one warm jacket, I took on the shortened week, and even managed to go for a run a couple mornings. I had to run wearing tracksuit pants though, the first time I have ever done so.

Because of the long weekend, I wanted to work hard this week to make up for the lost day. On Wednesday night, my friend Vincent asked if I wanted to grab dinner with him. We went to a pizza place in Redwood City, and got pizza by the slice and beers for $3.75. We then went to a German bar for more beers, CVS Pharmacy to buy hard liquor (yes, a pharmacy... there was a 1.25L bottle of Smirnoff for $18.) We then went to another friend's apartment to drink more, then to the local pub for Karaoke night.

As we walked in, some bloke decided he felt the need to butcher AC/DC's "You Shook Me All Night Long". We had some more drinks (Coronas for $5, get out of town) and then it was my and Vincent's turn. As we looked through the song book, we couldn't help but notice what wasn't there. Darryl Braithwaite's Horses? Nope. Paul Kelly? Nope. Cold Chisel? Nope. What we did find, however, was Down Under by Men at Work.

I feel like the song did the job, which was to announce to the entire pub "We're from Australia, and we're drunk and obnoxious". You know, classic Antipodean Abroad behavior. After some more drinks and preaching to the bartenders about how they should stock VB (not really), I called it a night.

Thursday was also an exciting day! Steven and I left work early to get to our new apartment, because we had a lease to sign and keys to pick up! We dumped our stuff at the apartment, and then went downstairs, where the staff put on a "Grand Opening" party, since so many leases started that day. We had more drinks (tequila this time) before going out to Mexican for dinner.

On Friday, I got up early and went for a run. After coming home and thawing out, I went to the new apartment. I planned to work from home in order to receive delivery of my mattress, which was supposed to be delivered. I sat at home and watched two shipping companies delivering goods from Sydney, as well as a different mattress company and AT&T all find their way to our apartment without any issues. Unfortunately, UPS couldn't be bothered delivering my mattress, so I sat at home all day for nothing.

On Friday afternoon, I did go in to the office to meet mum, who was over to visit. I showed her around the place, and we went for dinner in Palo Alto, before showing her the apartment. She insisted I meet her at 8am on Saturday to go for a run. At that point, I knew we were in for a busy Adrienne style day.

We went for a run through Stanford and up to the big satellite dish round the back of campus. It was an absolutely gorgeous run, from the top you could see over the entire Bay Area. I really wish I took my phone with to get some photos. We had to ask some locals for directions halfway through, and the conversation went something like this:

Hey sorry, do you know the way to the dish?

> Yeah yeah, I reckon you just head round that corner and up the trail.

On reflection, we figured out that the only other person out exercising at 8am on a Saturday would be another Australian.

After thawing out and getting some brekky, we went to IKEA where we spent four hours picking out gear for the apartment. IKEA offered us same day shipping, meaning after purchasing goods at 2pm, it was delivered into my living room at 5:30pm the same day. My room now has a desk (minus the top, which they were out of stock of), a rug, a bedside table, and the base for my bed. I still don't have a bed, which means every night I have to go back to the hotel and I can't move in yet.

Next stop was Bed Bath and Beyond, where I got towels, sheets and a doona, and mum and I learnt all sorts of things about bedding, like what a sham and a comforter are. It was then back to the apartment to receive delivery and start building our IKEA furniture (otherwise known as lego for grown ups).

We also found out that our new neighborhood as a Poke bar, just like Fishbowl at Bondi Beach. Brown rice and sashimi is about to become a staple of my diet (which is not a bad thing since I now have a family history of heart disease.)

On Sunday, mum and I went for brekky, before she insisted on buying food for our new place that I still can't actually live in yet. She then went off to the airport to go to New York, and I came back to the apartment. Steven and I went back to IKEA to pick up some stuff we missed, and being sick of taking Ubers everywhere ([Uber has also had some issues with sexism in management recently](https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2017/2/19/reflecting-on-one-very-strange-year-at-uber)) we enlisted the help of our friend Pierre, who has a car. This car happens to be a Ford Mustang Convertible, and it just happened to be a glorious day.

And that's been my week. Long and tiring, despite it being a short week. I'm hoping I can move in properly this week, because that will make things much easier for me, being in walking distance of downtown.

But it's back to work for me tomorrow, and I'm hopeful the weather gets warmer soon!
