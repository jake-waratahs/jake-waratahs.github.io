Hi again! Small update this time round, just to get myself back onto a schedule of updating on the weekends. 

Two big bits of news - one is that I've officially joined the Profile Expression team at Facebook - we're all about helping people express themselves! I really like the team and the work is really impactful. Like, billions of views per day impactful. I'm currently working on some new features for Profiles on the web interface, and I'll be moving on to Android as I learn more about the platform.

Anyway, the second piece of news is that I went up to Lake Tahoe this weekend with my friends Oliver and John. Tahoe is a ski resort about four hours drive from San Francisco, which straddles the California and Nevada border, which means that on one side of the mountain is desert, and a huge lake on the other.

I took some footage with my Gopro, but it's a little bit shaky, since it is literally a camera mounted on my head. Try looking at some of the views we got as we came down the mountain!
