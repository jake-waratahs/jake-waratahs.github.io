            Between Vallis Alps and The Choir Boys, there is a strong theme of paradise in Australian music

As opposed to travelling over to Las Vegas, this week was spent getting to know the local area a bit more. I've been up to the city and Berkley and down in the Bay plenty, in another typical big week for me packed with friends, code, and Australian music. Daylight savings has just started here (hello long nights), the sun has been out all week and it is starting to get warm!

<!--break--> 

Work this week has been good too - I've worked on a really diverse range of tasks, from Instagram on Android, to the main Facebook website, to an internal review tool, and I'm really starting to enjoy my routine. I've currently got code running in Instagram Servers and Facebook's internal tools. I've also got an experiment running in Facebook that is currently deployed for ten percent of users (that's about one hundred and eighty million people per month). In two weeks time anyone who uses Instagram on Android will be using code I wrote as well.

But the highlight of this week, in the absence of any of my parents being in town, was the touristy things I did. On Tuesday night I got the bus up to San Francisco to see an Australian Band called Vallis Alps. Originating from Canberra, an act that would cost $30 back in Australia played a smaller show for $13 in the USA. I got to the venue at about 8pm, and the band only made it on at 9:30 - but nobody cared! How great to live in a city that understands the value of live music and encourages it! On a Tuesday night!

I got a Lyft back to the train station (where the Indian cabbie gave me shit about the Cricket) and went back home.

Some other highlights at work this week included me holding the door open at the gym for Chris Cox, Facebook's Chief Product Officer, and me paying out electricity bill via A CHEQUE IN THE MAIL - sometimes it feels like you're stuck in 1990 here.

Another great discovery was that because of our internet deal, we get a free subscription to ESPN. That means we get to watch Super Rugby, for free! This came in handy as I was able to watch every second of the Waratahs' 37-14 defeat to the Durban Sharks. There's only one thing worse than losing, and that's losing to a South African team.

The big day was Sunday though. Steven, Bernice, Jayden and I were up early on Sunday, and caught the train up to San Francisco, before getting a Lyft to the gorgeous Marina District. We hired bikes from the Point Piper of San Francisco, and set off North, stopping at North Beach to stand around and look disgusted, on our way to Sausalito. The amazing thing about this ride is that you get to go over the Golden Gate Bridge. Not so amazing is that on the path up to the bridge, there's a sign reminding you that San Francisco is built on an active fault line and is overdue for an earthquake.

Sausalito feels more like a European village than an American town, as it's built on the side of a gorgeous mountain, has narrow cobblestone streets, and plenty of bikes. We were joined for lunch by Pierre, Vincent and Lucas before cruising through some touristy shops. There we were, seven UNSW alumnus, who six months ago would only eat at the cheapest restaurants on ANZAC parade. What a moment it was for us all.

After getting the ferry back to San Francisco, we rode on to Pier 39 and Fisherman's Wharf, where we watched some Sea Lions lazing around in the sun, before riding back up to the Marina District and dropping the bikes back. At this point I farewelled the others, as they head back home and I went into the Hayes Valley to go see another Aussie artist play - this time joined by Sarah, who I haven't seen since she met me at the airport. Early February probably feels like a lifetime ago for you, imagine how I feel!

Again, I was front row for the gig, which was great. I have seen Alex Lahey once before - at the Music Festival I went to the day before I flew out to San Francisco to interview at Facebook. So it was strange to think about just how much I had accomplished in the eight or so months since then.

Sarah and I then crashed at her parent's place in Berkeley, before getting up early to get back to work this morning. So it's been an intense but fun twenty four hours, with the travel map looking a little something like this:

This week I'm going to be sitting with and working with different teams as I look to make my mind up about where to work. I'm stuck between two teams at the moment, but I'm confident I'll be able to make a decision by the end of this week or early next week.

Until next time!
