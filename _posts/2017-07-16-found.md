                So there I am. Sitting cramped up in my seat, half asleep, looking out the plane window, just looking at the clouds. All of a sudden they part and there she is. 
                <br /><br />
                So I'm coming down looking over the city, all the familiar places I can see. I've seen it a million times before but, I don't know, something about that moment, it never looked so good

I board QF74, the direct flight from San Francisco to Sydney, and take my seat. The bloke who sits down next to me passes out almost instantly. Later on in the flight, he tells me he had some sleeping pills, and offered me some. While I appreciated the offer of pills from a stranger on a plane, I didn't take him up on it.

The week before, in Los Angeles, Dad told me that nobody wanted to battle Sunday morning traffic to come pick me up from the airport, so I was on my own. Luckily, my mate Mikey and Eryn wanted to come get me from the airport, so I had some friendly faces when I landed. All of a sudden, Martin Luther King Boulevard was swapped for Southern Cross Drive, Jefferson Avenue for George Street, Veterans Road for ANZAC Parade. I was home.

    And as we cruise through the alleys and the streets, I'm struck by the beauty of familiarity -  Big things, small things, all things in their place, I swear it's like I left just yesterday

We took Southern Cross Drive, onto South Dowling Street then ANZAC Parade and Old South Head Road to roll into Rose Bay. I walked back in to my family home to find Mum out for a run, Dad out with some mates, and David fast asleep. So I had a shower and some breakfast, caught up with the family and then went down to Bondi with Eryn for coffee and a walk. Later on I went over to Jordie's house and hung out for a while, before making it home and getting to sleep at 10pm after landing at 7am.

On Monday night I had lunch with Lavender and  dinner with Mikey, Jordie and Ryan. Tuesday was family dinner, Wednesday was origin, more family shenanigans on Friday, and on Saturday night I had some friends over for some drinks. At some point in the week, I did graduate from a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science. The ceremony was very efficiently run, and I got to see all my friends, up in robes, having a bit of a laugh.

Sadly, although having a fantastic week back at home, it was time to head back to California. I've been back three weeks now, and its been easy settling back in. The week after I came back, it was the fourth of July public holiday here, which included a parade round the corner from me, and lots of little kids waving American flags. John and I noted that it felt strange to celebrate a national day without also commemorating a genocide.

Sarah came over and we spent the day together, and it was really great to see her again. We spent the day by the pool and watched the fireworks

The next week, I was invited to a bonfire down at Ocean Beach in San Francisco. It was freezing cold and the water was more brown-green than blue, but it was still a really good night out. Usually the fog comes through the city in the evenings, but we managed to score a clear night and a glorious sunset over the water. (With a perfect soundtrack thanks to Bernard Fanning).

Since then I've been back at work, and even had an oncall shift this week (which means that if anything broke with Facebook profiles, I'd be the point of contact.)

Next week a bunch of us are going to see Book of Mormon in San Jose, and another round of the Aussies in SF drinks. I've kept this week's brief because everyone else's travels are far more interesting!

See you next time!
