Another really intense week here from the Bay Area. To be honest, there doesn't seem to be any other kind of week. I feel like I've pretty much settled in now, and as my routine takes shape, things are starting to feel good. I'm hitting the gym more, the weather is getting warmer, the days are getting longer, [The Nips are Getting Bigger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtCD6F9OG8o), etc.

At work, we are still in training, but the time has come to start talking to teams to see where we will end up working. I'm talking to quite a few teams at the moment, and hopefully by next week I'll be narrowed down to a few. A lot of the work that is happening is really exciting, and I really with I could write all about it (but that would breach a bunch of Non-Disclosure Agreements and likely get me fired).

The main project I have been working on this week has been to do with the Protect and Care team, which does really good work across the platform. From next week, I'll be A/B testing<sup>\[1\]</sup> a feature that I think will really help some people on Facebook. I really enjoyed this work, because the reason I got into computer science was to make people's lives easier. Getting to work on this feature that intersects well with my ambitions felt really good.

I got approval and checked the code in on Wednesday, and by Wednesday night it has deployed to a bunch of users<sup>\[2\]</sup>. On Thursday morning, I woke up to an email that said something along the lines of "Hey Jake, your fix broke this thing" and got assigned a task that said something to the effect of "High Priority: Fix it please". Everyone was super helpful and Friendly, and I was able to fix it all up before things got too serious. So yeah, I actually broke part of Facebook this week! How exciting!

I've now completely moved out of the hotel and into the new apartment with Steven, Bernice and John joined us this week. My mattress came on Monday night, and on Tuesday I moved my suitcases over and unpacked. Sadly we're still missing a few things, like a couch, a top for my desk, and a chair, but another IKEA run is taking place this weekend and we will grab everything that we missed. And if that fails, there's also Amazon.

On Sunday I ordered a Soldering Iron from Amazon, and on Monday afternoon it was in my mailbox. That's amazing. Why did you order a Soldering Iron, I hear you ask? There are a few electronics projects I want to work on, and hopefully I'll be able to post about those soon.

On Wednesday night, in the blissful hours between checking in my code and being told that I broke Facebook, I went up to San Francisco for a welcome dinner of sorts for John. We went out to a southern style restaurant, and while Vincent and John went for the fried chicken and waffles, I opted for the fried chicken po' boy, (fried chicken sandwich with coleslaw cheese and aioli) thinking it would have been healthier. It probably wasn't. I also had a huge grilled cheese sandwich for lunch at work on Friday. That's two bad meals in the one working week, so I'm going to be sticking to WheetBix and salads at least until after the Facebook half marathon in April. (Yes, Facebook has a half marathon, and yes, I have signed up for it.)

Which brings us to the weekend, which I have been looking forward to ever since Dad and I first booked our trip to Vegas. On Friday afternoon, I got a Lyft ([because fuck Uber](https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2017/2/19/reflecting-on-one-very-strange-year-at-uber)) to the airport, and boarded my Virgin America flight from SFO to LAS. People at work were asking the usual questions - Have you been to Vegas before? Have you ever gambled before? Are you over 21? Little did they know I wasn't there to piss my hard-earned away.

The Bloom boys were in town for the Rugby Sevens.

Dad and I met on Friday night and we went for dinner at Caesar's Palace (cue The Hangover jokes), which ended up being really good (or maybe we were really hungry). On Saturday, the fun started at the Rugby. We saw the Australian Women's team dust up Canada and we saw the men's lose to Fiji. (Argentina beat New Zealand though, so the day ended as a mixed bag.)

On Saturday afternoon, USA were scheduled to play England in a regular pool game. The Yanks went into full patriot mode, and had a singer doing the national anthem before the players ran out, complete with fireworks and soldiers marching. For a pool game. Of Rugby Sevens. And the crowd. Loved. Every. Second. Seriously, thirty-odd thousand people belting out "The Star-Spangled Banner" and full volume, hands on hearts, so proud of themselves. At times like this, I actually think that this country is a parody of itself. The Poms scored after the final hooter to beat the USA. Usually I hate seeing the old enemy win, but having the Seppos shut up all at once was damn satisfying.

We left the footy early on Saturday to go see a David Copperfield magic show, which was incredible. Dad and I are both skeptics at the best of times, but the show was really special! Like any good magician, from the shores of Circular Quay to the lights of Las Vegas, he loved to talk, and delay, and delay, and delay. Funny how some things don't change.

Sunday was more of the same - footy, footy, footy. Australia came in sixth place, with South Africa taking out the tournament. The crowd was amazing, and we saw some great footy against a stunning desert backdrop. Las Vegas now gets onto a prestigious list of Rugby weekends that Dad and I have done, along with Melbourne, Brisbane, Auckland, Wellington, Hamilton, Tokyo and Orange, NSW.

Today marks a month since I landed in the USA. In that time, I've managed to set up a bank account, social security, find an apartment, furnish it, have both my parents visit, and do some work in there as well. Next up, choosing a team at work, getting a drivers license, and possibly a car? Who knows...

One month down and feeling good!

\[1\]: [A/B testing](ihttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing) is a test that splits users into a control group and a test group, to see how a new feature impacts the test group compared to the control group.

\[2\]: Again, can't say how many users, NDAs, don't want to get fired, all that.
