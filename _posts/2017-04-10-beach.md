Last week, on Monday morning, I got up, got dressed, got the bus into work, and sat down at my desk. Since the majority of my team is on a research trip in Morocco, I was expecting a pretty cruisy week. Boy was I wrong.

<!--break-->

As it turns out, despite our manager and senior engineer being more or less unreachable in Africa for a week, we hadn't slowed down our schedule. This meant that last week, I was the senior engineer. I found this out on Monday, when our weekly meeting was myself, our Product Manager and two other engineers, who work on Android (I mainly work on the server side). 

So last week was actually a lot of fun - I learnt so much, got asked a lot of important questions and even had to make some design decisions. The senior engineer is back on Wednesday - I hope I haven't messed up his work too much!

So because of the heavy workload, there's not too much to report. I've been trying to keep up with my family back home's travels, but they're a bit all over the shop, somewhere between Hong Kong, England, Sydney, and does David have his passport yet?

On Thursday night, one of my teammates invited me to a games night. We got the shuttle up from work to her house in the gorgeous Sunset District of San Francisco. The trip took about an hour and thirty minutes in the pouring rain, snaking up the 101 highway into the city. All of us grabbed some burritos for dinner, except for our host ("It means I can drink three glasses of wine instead of five and get the same effects, plus not have a hangover!") and then dashed through the rain to her house. We ate dinner, and my ~~teammates~~ friends took turns guessing my age, all guessing either twenty two or twenty three. I still pity my friend Steven, who is still twenty.

I ended up leaving San Francisco on the 10:40 train, which should have got me back to Redwood City by 11:30. Annoyingly, some bastard decided to park his car on the train tracks (Seriously. What *is* wrong with Americans?). This meant that I only arrived back at midnight, and after some calls from back home, it was one in the morning by the time I managed to get to sleep.

On Friday morning, I was supposed to run a half marathon, but it had been pouring with rain and it was a cross country course. When I woke up, I decided that I didn't really want to trudge through twenty one kilometres of mud on four and a half hours of sleep. I rolled over and slept through a race for the first time since the City to Surf in 2014.

I had been invited to a road trip down to Santa Cruz by another Australian bloke I know from work, and I figured why not. On Friday arvo, I jumped into a VW Golf with two guys I'd never met before and we hit the number 17 highway that twists and turns it's way from San Jose to Santa Cruz. Since it snakes through the mountains, we were driving through plenty of fog to get there, and because of all the rain, it was lush and green. 

In fact, the drive down looked more like a scene from Wuthering Heights, in the English Highlands, instead of the road down to the progressive sleepy beach town that is Santa Cruz.

I'd only ever been to the University there before, and had never actually seen the town. And gee, it was gorgeous. If you've ever seen those timber houses along Cliff Street and Cove Street at Camp Cove, that's what every house in Santa Cruz looks like, except they're not squashed together. People were out jogging, walking their dogs and getting coffee. The sun came out on Saturday morning, and I went for a walk on the coastal walk from the Main Beach to Mitchell Cove. Sound familiar? If you stand in the sun on the coastal work, close your eyes and imagine, you could be on the walk from Bondi to Bronte.

Needless to say, I love Santa Cruz.

On Saturday afternoon, I left the group and went to Sarah's house. We baked cookies and talked about just about everything under the sun, and hung out with her boyfriend Jesse, who is a really nice bloke. By this stage, I was pretty knackered from the week of work and a few late nights were lining up with the fact that I had been walking around in shorts in cold weather. I was feeling pretty crook, so took the bus and train back to my apartment, but not before warning Sarah that as soon as I get my license and a car, I'm going to visit her every weekend.

On Sunday, I woke up feeling like death warmed over. I cooked some average spag bol, and did bugger all until I had to. Eventually I showered and shaved, and Pierre gave me, Steven. Bernice and John a lift into the city to go for dinner at Oliver, Vanessa and George's apartment, where we met our friend Vincent. Once again, nine Australians in the room together. 

Oliver took a sushi making class in Japan and made us all sushi, which was really good. We listened to Violent Soho, Paul Kelly, Powderfinger and Hilltop Hoods. Eventually, we made our way back down south, and I crashed and burned before eleven pm, which was much needed.

I woke up on Monday to plenty of photos from my family seder back home, all dressed in white - clearly they liked our Cricket Whites from last year! I got dressed in black jeans and a smart shirt and head into work - I was heading up to Berkeley to the Bloom's seder and I wasn't going back to Redwood City first. I got some strange looks at work for being dressed up so much, and it felt really strange to be writing code while looking so fancy.

The first nights seder was long - we lit candles at seven pm and finished Chad Gadya as the clock struck midnight. The Blooms assured me that this was a speed run for them. Back home, we seem to get sick of each other after three hours!

Last night, I went to the Synagogue at Redwood City. I was told that we would kick off at 5:30pm, so I got there at 6pm. To my horror, they had started on time, and I had missed the first glass of wine. This seder went until about 10pm thankfully, and I was able to make it home at a decent hour.

Despite being a bit sick over the past few days, I'm starting to get better and my family comes to visit this weekend, we're heading to Portland.

Until next time!
