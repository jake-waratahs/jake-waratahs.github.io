I'm not going to lie here, this first week has been difficult. I expected it to be lonely and sad though, I maybe didn't expect to spend twenty minutes on Thursday night watching a [live webcam of Sydney Harbour](http://www.webcamsydney.com/) while listening to Paul Kelly's [How to Make Gravy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoJxigEuVC4) on repeat.

But it's been a week now, and now that I've been through a week here, I can do anything, and nothing can stop me. Except for security when I tried to buy a bottle of wine at a self-checkout at Target. (You can buy alcohol at Target here, it's messed up.) The sun came out on Friday and stayed out. I've prepared a total of two meals, Honey Soy Chicken and Spaghetti Bolognaise, and I haven't died of food poisoning yet. I've been to the gym three whole times. I've worked a whole week at Facebook and I haven't broken anything yet. So I guess you could say I'm on a bit of a roll.

This weekend has been spent looking for places to live, because there's no way I'm staying in this hotel forever. Steven and I have seen some really nice places over the past few days, but it's been challenging, when our third roommate, John, is still back home in Sydney. Saying that though, we found the place we want to live. It's close to our friends in Redwood City, it's a new building, and we got it on a great deal from the building management. We've applied and fingers crossed it all comes through.

On Saturday arvo, I got the train up to San Francisco, which took just under an hour. I went up to the city to visit my friends Oliver and Vanessa. The similarities between Sydney and San Francisco are well documented, but it still feels good when I step off the notoriously unreliable train system and almost get knocked down by a bloke running past in full active wear.

I met Vanessa at her and Oliver's apartment, where they have a giant poster of Shannon Noll and the Australian Flag from The Simpsons, along with a collection of Tim Tams and Milo. We walked down to Market Street to watch the Chinese New Year parade, followed by dinner at a place called "Super Duper Burger" (Bar Luca's burgers are better). I got back to the hotel, just in time to hear about Fire Warnings in New South Wales, Flood Warnings in South Australia and Snow in Tassie.

We're going out today to look for some more places to live - while yesterday we were looking in San Mateo and Redwood City, today we are going to be in Mountain View and Palo Alto. While Palo Alto is the best place for us to be, it's the Double Bay of the area - Double Pay. So we will see what we can find, but we're really hoping that first place comes through.

Tomorrow morning I'm going to apply for a Social Security Number, the head in to work for some more training classes. This doesn't feel normal yet, but it's certainly starting to feel normal. And I really think I'm going to be okay here.
