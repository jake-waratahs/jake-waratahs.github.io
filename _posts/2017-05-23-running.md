As I recall, I published the previous post here as I was walking out the door to go to a housewarming party in San Francisco. 

<!--break-->

If I'm being honest, I don't remember too much of that night. I went along to the party and played some card games and had a few beers, before getting my arse kicked at beer pong, and moving onto vodka, before we head out to a bar in the Mission District.

The Mission is famous for authentic grade Mexican street food, street art and culture, and if there was any of that, I didn't see it from the inside of the bar we went to. The ten or so of us took up the whole back of the bar, and had a great time throughout the night. In exchange for the lift up to the city, I bought everyone a round of drinks, and ended up getting home at about two in the morning.

On Sunday I stayed in bed and drank lots of water.

My performance (and ability to buy drinks) was clearly appreciated, because I was invited back the next weekend to go to the beach with one of the girls I met at the party and some of her friends. Having no idea what I was getting myself into, I went in a long sleeve top and boardies, with thongs. I was a little worried when some of the girls turned up in activewear, but we didn't do anything too strenuous. 

My friend Gaby was dog-sitting a choc labrador, so we took it out onto the beach and for a walk up the Pacific Coast, which was incredible. I even got to swim in the ocean, which was bloody freezing!

At this point I'll interject myself with a bit of a history lesson. You see, back in 1848, as the Mexican-American war ended, gold was discovered in California. This started the first Gold Rush (the second one started in 1851 when gold was found in Bendigo and Ballarat) and sparked huge migration to San Francisco in 1849. The local NFL team is known as the 49ers, named after these immigrants.

Many of these immigrants were former Irish convicts, who moved over from the penal colonies of New South Wales and Victoria. These blokes moved to the USA and promptly formed a gang, known as the "Sydney Ducks". So influential were the ducks, that the area now known as North Beach used to be called Sydney Town. The ducks would start fires and loot warehouses while people were out fighting the fires. They would then solicit bribes from local shopkeepers in exchange for immunity from their arson attacks, and take the money back to the brothels and sly grog shops they ran.

On May 3rd of 1851, the Sydney Ducks started a fire so large that it destroyed two thousand buildings and caused twelve million dollars worth of damage. A lynch mob of over one thousand people soon formed (the population of SF at the time was twenty thousand) and two members of the Sydney Ducks were hanged. 

The rest of the gang decided to lay low, and eventually moved back to Australia to try their luck on the gold fields there instead.

What relevance does this have today? Well, as it happens, a group of expatriate Australians called the Sydney Ducks meet on the third Thursday of every month at a bar in North Beach. The bar was chosen because it is the closest establishment to the starting point of the fire. This month I wore my Triple J tshirt, and met a bloke who had a Triple J tattoo. We're a more peaceful lot these days.

On the third weekend in May every year, there's a twelve kilometre fun run through San Francisco. It starts in the middle of the CBD, heads south towards Hayes Valley, then turns and runs up Hayes Hill, before snaking it's way back down to the Pacific Ocean. Most people dress up, there are street parties and musicians along the trail, and plenty of alcohol consumed. Sound familiar? That's right, this week I ran the imitation brand City to Surf!

Of course, it's slightly different. For some reason, people like to throw tortillas at each other during the race, and plenty of people run the race naked. (These tend to be mostly blokes). I ran the twelve kilometres in 53 minutes, which means I haven't gotten any slower since last year. As you get closer to the coast, the fog gets denser, which means you run into the fog. It's really quite special and made me feel more like a local.

And from feeling like a local I went to probably the most dense gathering of Australians in America this weekend. On Sunday night, I went to see Paul Kelly play live in the Castro Valley in San Francisco. The first half of his set were all covers of songs he had been asked to play at funerals, which was slightly depressing but also very beautiful, and paid lip service to the Americans who couldn't tell St. Kilda from Kings Cross.

Once the first half of the show was finished, a huge cheer went up from the crowd as the great man launched right into the opening riff of "To Her Door". He made everyone laugh with his banter between songs, he made everyone cry by playing "How To Make Gravy" and "Deeper Water", he made everyone shout by playing "Dumb Things" and he sent us home feeling good about the world by finishing off with "From Little Things Big Things Grow".

What could possibly top that? This weekend I am seeing Midnight Oil.
