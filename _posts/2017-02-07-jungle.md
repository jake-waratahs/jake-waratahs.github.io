February 5th 2017. February 5th 2017. February 5th 2017. I moved to the United States of America on February 5th 2017. Not 5/2/17, because that doesn't make sense here.

<!--break-->

It was really hot in Sydney when I left. It wasn't any temperature specifically, because quoting a number in the thirties means cold here.

In the taxi, I sat on the right hand side, but I wasn't driving. When I got to the hotel I'm staying at, people were watching a sport where you could pass forward and obstruct players.

### Sunday (Sydney)
On Sunday, I was woken to the sounds of my phone alarm going off. I sat up to see a bright red sunrise outside my window, before throwing on some active wear and heading out to do the Bondi to Bronte run with Mum.

After a run and a swim, I had breakfast at Harry's with Ryan and Lavender, and I'm really glad I got to say a proper goodbye to them. Once we finished breakfast, I got to go see Lee, Rob and the Baby, before heading to see Dad, then getting on the plane.

Once I was in the lounge, I was able to relax and make some final phone calls and review everything I needed to. I got on the plane, downed a glass of champagne, watched a stupid movie and went to sleep.

### Sunday (San Francisco)
On Sunday, I was woken to the sounds of breakfast being served aboard a Qantas 747 over the Pacific Ocean. I sat up to see the San Francisco Bay Area stretching out over the horizon, before throwing on jeans and a shirt and getting set to land.

After making it through customs and quarantine, I caught the train to Berkley with my cousin Sarah, and it was really sweet of her to meet me at the airport. Once we hopped off the train, we walked around Berkley for a while and got lunch.

I came back to my hotel later on, and watched some of the gridiron game with my mate Vincent. I then met my friends Steven and Bernice and went for dinner with them, before declaring and calling it a day. I was absolutely buggered, it was cold and I was missing home. It was time to go to bed. I had a big day on Monday.

### Monday
Determined to beat jet lag, I got up at six in the morning in order to check out the gym at the complex I was staying at. (Making my mum proud. That's m**u**m, with a u.) After a crack on the treadmill (I couldn't really figure out miles per hour) and some fumbling around with weights (I couldn't really figure out pounds), I decided to just go have a shower and head into work instead.

Thankfully, they served breakfast at work (which was lucky since I forgot to buy milk to go with my milo and weetbix). On our first day, we had a bunch of talks about the mission, values and culture of the company. I'm sadly not going to be able to share everything that happened and everything we learned, but a lot of it was interesting, and I made some new friends along the way too.

I missed the 5:45pm bus back to my apartment, so was just hanging around the office chatting with some people that I had met at orientation, when some of the recruiting team new hires came up to me and asked if I wanted to go out to a bar in Palo Alto.

It was my first day on the job, my second night in a new country, I was fighting a losing battle against jet lag, and I missed my family and friends.

Of course I went out.

The night itself was a whole heap of fun - I drank plenty of sangria, found out a whole lot about what it's like recruiting for Facebook, and made three amazing friends. I got home late, drank three bottles of water, and crashed.

### Tuesday
Tuesday meant one thing to the new hires, and that was **oh my god today is the day we get our new phones and laptops!!!!**

Thankfully for me, this meant no longer having to rely on having WiFi to call an Uber, or speak to family and friends. I now have a shiny new laptop, a shiny new phone (message me if you want my USA number) and a way to get work done. I met my mentor and took a good walk around campus.

Orientation finished up, and since I'm not assigned to a team yet (I'm still in what's called "bootcamp"), I can only work from hot-desks. So I sat myself down at a desk, plugged in, and there was Steven sitting across from me. I spent the afternoon reading and catching up on emails, doing some paperwork to open up a bank account, and (successfully) trying to use the printer. Plenty more friends were made, and I'm looking forward to really starting work.

When I got home this afternoon, I went for a walk out to the local grocery store and loaded up on food to have at home (yes I brought some Granny Smith apples too). For dinner I made myself some Honey Soy Chicken and Brown Rice (that's right, I can actually cook with things that aren't a barbecue.)

It's now 10:30pm on Tuesday, and this whole experience still doesn't feel real. I badly miss Sydney, I miss everyone at home and I miss the beaches and warm weather (it's raining here too, but it's cold.) But tomorrow is a new day to tackle, and I'm ready to take it on.

Welcome to the Jungle, kiddo.
