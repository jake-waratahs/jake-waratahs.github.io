            No real reason to use this song other than the fact I've been listening to it and think it's really good.

Sorry. I should have updated this sooner - it's been about a month since I last updated my blog, which means that it's now been three months since I left Sydney. In the past month, I've been visited by my family, I've worked hard, I've done a bit of relaxation, been to a Baseball game and been to yet another concert.

    Can't believe the curators have left this much grass on the pitch, bowlers paradise out there.

A few weeks ago, I left work a bit early and met my friends who live up in the city. They work at Dropbox, so I got to have a look around the office there and then we walked to AT&T Park to watch the San Francisco Giants play (they're a baseball team). The stadium was awesome, the food was awful, and SF had a big win. All round, a good evening.

After that, Mum, Dad and Dave came to town, which was really lovely. We had one night in SF, where we walked around Haight-Ashbury (where the Summer of Love started) and Golden Gate Park, before dinner and heading off to bed. They met me at work on the Friday, and then we got a flight up to Portland.

    From the hair to the face to the Australian music shirt, we're starting to look scarily similar.

We had a great weekend up in the North West, we did a hike, ate lots, spent twenty minutes at attractions that are supposed to take hours, had a fight, all the normal family things condensed into a weekend. David and I also confused a bunch of waiters by using the same ID to try and convince them that we were both over twenty one. It didn't work.


After getting back to San Francisco, we had dinner on Monday night in Palo Alto, before my family went back home, which was pretty sad. If I'm being honest, I haven't done too much exciting since. I've been working hard, and just relaxing on the weekends.

    So bright and so warm!

Last week was real hot - it got up to about thirty two during the day (that's Celsius) and not a cloud in the sky. The sun also doesn't set until later here, so by the time I get home at six in the evening, I could still spend an hour lying by the pool in the sun with a book.

    This band is called "The Running Mates". John and I liked them.

Last weekend John and I went to see a local band, The Y Axes, whose music we really like. We went to a part of San Francisco that we had never been to before, and the only impression we had of it was the train station, which was underneath an overpass and not particulairly flattering. So we weren't looking forward to the twenty minute walk up to the venue, but boy were we proven wrong. Portero Hill turned out to be a lovely neighbourhood, and the club, Bottom of the Hill, was a great place, which played music that lined up very much with Triple J. John and I felt right at home.

    It's a bit blurry, but so was my vision at this point. A few beers in, on the walk back to the train.

I'm going to try do some more exciting things now. I'm going to a party in SF tonight, and I've got my driving permit (effectively my L plates) now, so I'm one step closer to being more mobile.

I'm also coming home in forty one days. Cannot wait!
