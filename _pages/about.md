# G'Day.

My name is Jake Bloom - I was born and grew up in Sydney Australia, and I'm about to relocate to California, USA to take a job. I studied Computer Science at UNSW Australia from 2014 to 2016. I'm experienced in C, Python, Java, Javascript, Bash, SQL, ReactJS, Docker and dabble in plenty more languages and technologies.

I've got a keen interest in security and operating systems, and I'm an advocate for more diversity and inclusion of minority groups in the technology sector.

Away from my career, I'm a huge rugby fan, especially of the NSW Waratahs. I run quite a bit too, and play the drums.
