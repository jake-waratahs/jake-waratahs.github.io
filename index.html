  <h1>Welcome!</h1>
  <p>
    If you're here, it means you're probably part of my family, or a close enough friend to be considered family. Anyway, I'm going to be using this website to update details about my impending move to America, so friends and family can find information right here! Eventually, closer when I move, I'll probably turn it into more of a blog so anyone who is interested can stay updated about my life.
  </p>
  <h3>What's Going On?</h3>
  <p>
    I've recieved a job offer from <a href="http://facebook.com">Facebook</a>, and I've decided that I'm going to take it. Facebook's office is in Menlo Park, California, which means I'm going to be moving to America.
  </p>
  <h3>Why Did You Take The Job?</h3>
  <p>
    The problems that Facebook comes up against every day are totally unlike any problems any other tech company has. How do you scale a social network to over a billion users? How do you keep it reliable? How do you consistently attract new users once you have reached a critical mass? These are the sorts of problems I am going to get to work on.
    <br>
    Also, I'm at a point in my life where I have nothing to lose, and nobody depending on me financially. It's an incredible oppertunity to go live and work overseas.
  </p>
  <h3>When Are You Leaving?</h3>
  <p>
    My start date is slated for February 7th, 2017. This means I get to be in Australia for a lot of important events over the summer, like Christmas, New Years, my Grandfather's birthday, my Father's birthday, my twenty-first birthday, my best friend's twenty-first birthday, Australia Day (and the Triple J Hottest 100), the Cricket season and the Sydney 7s Rugby tournament.
  </p>
  <h3>How Long Will You Be Gone?</h3>
  <p>
    Dunno. Absolute minimum one year, but I'll probably end up staying a bit longer. I do want to come back eventually, so I promise I'm not going forever.
  </p>
  <h3>Where Will You Live?</h3>
  <p>
    Again, dunno. But I've got a few mates already living over there, and some going over around the same time I am, so we will figure something out.
  </p>
  <h3>Has Your Mother Threatened To Follow You Yet?</h3>
  <p>
    Yes.
  </p>
  <h3>How's Uni Going?</h3>
  <p>
    Glad you asked! It's going really well. It's sad that I'll be leaving after this semester because I have enjoyed it so much. I'm really loving my time at Uni at the moment because I'm doing a few really interesting courses.
